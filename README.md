Several of the scripts assume that the ovarian cancer datasets are already downloaded - for instructions on how to download, see main_simulation.R

Each of the Figures or Tables from the paper has an associated .R file which contains code to replicate the plot. At the top of each file are instructions for which scripts to run first in order to generate the data necessary to create the plot.
